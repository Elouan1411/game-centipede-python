The game includes sounds and different colors based on the level progression.

## Features

- Progressive difficulty levels
- Different points for different targets
- High score display and storage
- Directional movement with arrow keys
- Shooting with the space bar
- Sound effects for various actions
- Dynamic color changes based on levels
- **Dark mode and light mode:** Switch between dark and light modes during gameplay
